# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [0.79.5] - 2026-06-16

### Changed

- Updated Markdown parsing to `marked` 18.0.5.

### Fixed

- Fixed editor Cursor Up handling so non-empty drafts jump to the start of the line before browsing input history.

## [0.79.4] - 2026-06-15

### Added

- Added terminal background color query support for OSC 11 replies.

### Fixed

- Fixed overlay compositing over CJK wide characters so borders stay aligned when an overlay starts inside a full-width cell.
- Fixed WezTerm inline Kitty image rendering during full redraw fallbacks so image padding rows are reserved before the placement is drawn without regressing tall-image placement.

## [0.79.3] - 2026-06-13

## [0.79.2] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed

- Fixed Markdown source list marker preservation to include unordered markers, so standalone `+` user messages no longer render as `-`.
- Fixed slash-separated fuzzy queries so provider/model completions remain matchable after insertion.
- Fixed WezTerm inline Kitty image rendering so reserved row clears do not erase all but the top strip of tool image previews.
- Fixed editor wrapping for CJK text to break at character boundaries instead of leaving large trailing gaps.
- Fixed loose Markdown list rendering to preserve blank-line separation between list items.

## [0.79.1] - 2026-06-09

### Added

- Added `AutocompleteProvider.triggerCharacters` so editor autocomplete can naturally trigger on provider-defined token prefixes.

### Fixed

- Fixed IME hardware cursor positioning while slash-command autocomplete is visible.
- Fixed prompt history navigation to restore the current draft when returning from history browsing.
- Fixed wrapping for mixed Latin and CJK text so unspaced CJK runs can break at grapheme boundaries without leaving large trailing gaps.

## [0.79.0] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- Fixed intermittent Shift+Enter handling by making Kitty keyboard protocol fallback response-driven instead of timeout-driven.
- Fixed TUI rendering to clear stale lines when content shrinks to zero.
- Fixed autocomplete suggestions to re-query after editor cursor movement.

## [0.78.1] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed

## [0.75.4] - 2026-05-20

### Changed

- Removed the package-level development watch script now that the root TypeScript check validates strip-only-compatible sources.

### Fixed

## [0.73.1] - 2026-05-07

### Fixed

- Fixed wrapped OSC 8 hyperlinks to preserve BEL terminators so OAuth login URLs remain clickable on every wrapped line.

## [0.70.6] - 2026-04-28

## [0.70.5] - 2026-04-27

## [0.70.4] - 2026-04-27

## [0.70.3] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed

- Fixed duplicate printable characters from Kitty keyboard protocol CSI-u plus raw character input on layouts such as Italian

## [0.70.2] - 2026-04-24

## [0.70.1] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed

- Fixed CSI-u Ctrl+letter decoding inside bracketed paste, so pasted modified-key escape sequences no longer become literal editor text

## [0.70.0] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed

- Kept OSC 9;4 terminal progress alive with periodic updates so Ghostty does not clear the indicator during long-running agent work

## [0.69.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added

- Added `setProgress(active: boolean)` to the `Terminal` interface for OSC 9;4 progress indicator support
- Added generic stacked autocomplete support for extension wrappers via `AutocompleteProvider.shouldTriggerFileCompletion?` and `#` as a natural autocomplete trigger alongside `@`

## [0.68.1] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed

- Fixed `@` autocomplete fuzzy search to follow symlinked directories and include symlinked paths in results

## [0.68.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added

- Added `LoaderIndicatorOptions` and `Loader.setIndicator` support for custom loader frames and animation intervals, allowing TUI consumers to use animated, static, or hidden loader indicators

### Fixed

- Fixed `@` autocomplete fuzzy search to stop matching against the full base path for plain queries, so worktree or cwd paths containing the query text no longer crowd out real results such as `@plan` suggestions
- Fixed xterm `modifyOtherKeys` printable input so shifted uppercase letters insert correctly in the editor and shifted letter bindings parse and match consistently

## [0.67.68] - 2026-04-17

## [0.67.67] - 2026-04-17

## [0.67.6] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- Added OSC 8 hyperlink rendering for markdown links when the terminal advertises support. Introduces a public `hyperlink(text, url)` helper and a `setCapabilities` test override in `packages/tui`.
- Added `argumentHint` to `SlashCommand` interface, displayed before the description in the autocomplete dropdown

### Changed

- Tightened `detectCapabilities` to default `hyperlinks: false` for unknown terminals and to force `hyperlinks: false` under tmux/screen (including nested sessions where the outer terminal would otherwise advertise OSC 8). Prevents markdown link URLs from disappearing on terminals that silently swallow OSC 8 sequences.

## [0.67.5] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed

- Fixed Zellij `Shift+Enter` regressions by reverting the Zellij-specific Kitty keyboard query bypass and restoring the previous keyboard negotiation behavior

## [0.67.4] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed

- Fixed markdown strikethrough parsing to require strict double-tilde delimiters (`~~text~~`) with non-whitespace boundaries, preventing accidental strikethrough from loose tilde usage.

## [0.67.2] - 2026-04-14

### Added

- Added full helper support for Kitty `super`-modified shortcuts, including combinations such as `super+k`, `super+enter`, and `ctrl+super+k`

### Fixed

- Fixed Ctrl+Alt letter key matching in tmux by falling through from legacy ESC-prefixed handling to CSI-u and xterm `modifyOtherKeys` parsing when the legacy form does not match

## [0.67.1] - 2026-04-13

## [0.67.0] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed

- Fixed `Container.render` stack overflow on long sessions by replacing `Array.push(...spread)` with a loop-based push, preventing `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded` when child output exceeds the V8 call stack argument limit
- Fixed editor sticky-column tracking around paste markers so vertical cursor navigation restores the column from before the cursor entered a paste marker instead of jumping inside or past pasted content
- Fixed TUI test suite failures caused by render throttle scheduling: added `VirtualTerminal.waitForRender` helper that waits for the 16ms throttled render pipeline to settle before asserting viewport state

## [0.66.1] - 2026-04-08

## [0.66.0] - 2026-04-08

## [0.65.2] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed

- Fixed render scheduling under heavy streaming output by coalescing `requestRender` calls to a 16ms frame budget while preserving immediate `requestRender(true)` behavior.

## [0.65.1] - 2026-04-05

## [0.65.0] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed

- Fixed markdown H1 headings ending with inline code from leaking underline styling into trailing line padding
- Fixed slash-command argument autocomplete to await async `getArgumentCompletions` results and ignore invalid return values, preventing crashes when extension commands provide asynchronous completions
- Fixed non-capturing overlay padding from inflating scrollback and corrupting the viewport on terminal widen

## [0.64.0] - 2026-03-29

### Fixed

- Fixed TUI cell size response handling to consume only exact `CSI 6 ; height ; width t` replies, so bare `Escape` is no longer swallowed while waiting for terminal image metadata
- Fixed Kitty keyboard protocol keypad functional keys to normalize to logical digits, symbols, and navigation keys, so numpad input in terminals such as iTerm2 no longer inserts Private Use Area gibberish or gets ignored

## [0.63.2] - 2026-03-29

## [0.63.1] - 2026-03-27

## [0.63.0] - 2026-03-27

### Added

- Added support for `MISUL_TUI_WRITE_LOG` directory paths, creating a unique log file (`tui-<timestamp>-<pid>.log`) per instance for easier debugging of multiple misul sessions

### Fixed

- Fixed blockquote text color breaking after inline links (and other inline elements) due to missing style restoration prefix
- Fixed slash-command Tab completion from immediately chaining into argument autocomplete after completing the command name, restoring flows like `/model` that submit into a selector dialog
- Fixed stale content and incorrect viewport tracking after TUI content shrinks or transient components inflate the working area
- Fixed `@` autocomplete to debounce editor-triggered searches, cancel in-flight `fd` lookups cleanly, and keep suggestions visible while results refresh


## [0.62.0] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed

- Fixed `truncateToWidth` to stream truncation for very large strings, keep contiguous prefixes, and always terminate truncated SGR styling safely
- Fixed markdown heading styling being lost after inline code spans within headings

## [0.61.1] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed

- Fixed shared keybinding resolution to stop user overrides from evicting unrelated default shortcuts such as selector confirm and editor cursor keys
- Fixed Termux software keyboard height changes from forcing full-screen redraws and replaying TUI history on every toggle

## [0.61.0] - 2026-03-20

### Breaking Changes

- Replaced the editor-only keybinding store with a single global keybindings manager in `@misul/tui`. TUI keybinding ids are now namespaced: `cursorUp` -> `tui.editor.cursorUp`, `cursorDown` -> `tui.editor.cursorDown`, `cursorLeft` -> `tui.editor.cursorLeft`, `cursorRight` -> `tui.editor.cursorRight`, `cursorWordLeft` -> `tui.editor.cursorWordLeft`, `cursorWordRight` -> `tui.editor.cursorWordRight`, `cursorLineStart` -> `tui.editor.cursorLineStart`, `cursorLineEnd` -> `tui.editor.cursorLineEnd`, `jumpForward` -> `tui.editor.jumpForward`, `jumpBackward` -> `tui.editor.jumpBackward`, `pageUp` -> `tui.editor.pageUp`, `pageDown` -> `tui.editor.pageDown`, `deleteCharBackward` -> `tui.editor.deleteCharBackward`, `deleteCharForward` -> `tui.editor.deleteCharForward`, `deleteWordBackward` -> `tui.editor.deleteWordBackward`, `deleteWordForward` -> `tui.editor.deleteWordForward`, `deleteToLineStart` -> `tui.editor.deleteToLineStart`, `deleteToLineEnd` -> `tui.editor.deleteToLineEnd`, `yank` -> `tui.editor.yank`, `yankPop` -> `tui.editor.yankPop`, `undo` -> `tui.editor.undo`, `newLine` -> `tui.input.newLine`, `submit` -> `tui.input.submit`, `tab` -> `tui.input.tab`, `copy` -> `tui.input.copy`, `selectUp` -> `tui.select.up`, `selectDown` -> `tui.select.down`, `selectPageUp` -> `tui.select.pageUp`, `selectPageDown` -> `tui.select.pageDown`, `selectConfirm` -> `tui.select.confirm`, `selectCancel` -> `tui.select.cancel`. `keybindings.json` stays backward compatible because each keybinding definition maps the new internal id back to the existing public config key. Apps extend `interface Keybindings` via declaration merging, create one manager with both TUI and app definitions, then install it with `setKeybindings(...)`

### Fixed

- Fixed user-defined keybindings to shadow conflicting default bindings across the shared registry, so app-level defaults no longer stay active when the same key is explicitly reassigned

## [0.60.0] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed

- Fixed tmux xterm `modifyOtherKeys` matching for `Backspace`, `Escape`, and `Space`, and resolved raw `\x08` backspace ambiguity by treating Windows Terminal sessions differently from legacy terminals

## [0.59.0] - 2026-03-17

## [0.58.4] - 2026-03-16

## [0.58.3] - 2026-03-15

## [0.58.2] - 2026-03-15

### Added

- Added configurable `SelectList` primary column sizing via `SelectListLayoutOptions`, including custom primary-label truncation hooks

### Fixed

- Fixed stale scrollback remaining after full-screen redraws such as session switches by clearing the screen before wiping scrollback
- Fixed trailing blank lines after markdown block elements when they are followed immediately by the next block or end of document

## [0.58.1] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed

- Fixed Windows shell and path handling in autocomplete to properly handle drive letters and mixed path separators
- Fixed editor paste to preserve literal content instead of normalizing newlines, preventing content corruption for text with embedded escape sequences
- Fixed tab completion to preserve `./` prefix when completing relative paths
- Fixed `ctrl+backspace` being indistinguishable from plain `backspace` on Windows Terminal. `0x08` is now recognized as `ctrl+backspace` instead of `backspace`, making `ctrl+backspace` bindable on terminals where it produces a distinct byte

## [0.58.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added

- Added paste marker atomic segment handling in editor, treating paste markers as indivisible units during word wrapping and cursor navigation

### Fixed

- Fixed `Input` horizontal scrolling for wide Unicode text (CJK, fullwidth characters) to use visual column width and strict slice boundaries, preventing rendered line overflow and TUI crashes
- Fixed xterm `modifyOtherKeys` handling for `Tab` in `matchesKey`, restoring `shift+tab` and other modified Tab bindings in tmux when `extended-keys-format` is left at the default `xterm`
- Fixed editor scroll indicator rendering crash in narrow terminal widths
- Fixed tab characters in editor `setText` and input paths not being normalized to spaces
- Fixed `wordWrapLine` overflow when wide characters (CJK, fullwidth) fall exactly at the wrap boundary
- Fixed tab characters in `Input` paste not being normalized to spaces

## [0.57.1] - 2026-03-07

### Added

- Added `treeFoldOrUp` and `treeUnfoldOrDown` editor actions with default bindings for `Ctrl+←`/`Ctrl+→` and `Alt+←`/`Alt+→`
- Added digit keys (`0-9`) to the keybinding system, including Kitty CSI-u and xterm `modifyOtherKeys` support for bindings like `ctrl+1`

### Fixed

- Fixed autocomplete selection ignoring typed text: highlight now follows the first prefix match as the user types, and exact matches are always selected on Enter
- Fixed xterm `modifyOtherKeys` parsing in `matchesKey` and `parseKey`, restoring Ctrl-based keybindings and modified Enter keys in tmux when `extended-keys-format` is left at the default `xterm`
- Fixed slash-command Tab completion to immediately open argument completions when available

## [0.57.0] - 2026-03-07

### Added

- Added non-capturing overlays via `OverlayOptions.nonCapturing` and new `OverlayHandle` methods: `focus`, `unfocus`, and `isFocused` for programmatic overlay focus control

### Changed

- Overlay compositing order now uses focus order so focused overlays render on top while preserving stack semantics for show/hide behavior

### Fixed

- Fixed automatic focus restoration to skip non-capturing overlays and fixed `hideOverlay` to only reassign focus when the popped overlay had focus

## [0.56.3] - 2026-03-06

### Added

- Added xterm modifyOtherKeys mode 2 fallback when Kitty keyboard protocol is not available, enabling modified enter keys (Shift+Enter, Ctrl+Enter) inside tmux

## [0.56.2] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Exported `decodeKittyPrintable` from `keys.ts` for decoding Kitty CSI-u sequences into printable characters

### Fixed

- Fixed `Input` component not accepting typed characters when Kitty keyboard protocol is active (e.g., VS Code 1.110+), causing model selector filter to ignore keystrokes
- Fixed editor/footer visibility drift during terminal resize by forcing full redraws when terminal width or height changes.

## [0.56.1] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- Fixed markdown blockquote rendering to isolate blockquote styling from default text style, preventing style leakage.

## [0.56.0] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed

- Fixed TUI width calculation for regional indicator symbols (e.g. partial flag sequences like `🇨` during streaming) to prevent wrap drift and stale character artifacts in differential rendering.
- Fixed Kitty CSI-u handling to ignore unsupported modifiers so modifier-only events do not insert stray printable characters
- Fixed single-line paste performance by inserting pasted text atomically instead of character-by-character, preventing repeated `@` autocomplete scans during paste
- Fixed `visibleWidth` to ignore generic OSC escape sequences (including OSC 133 semantic prompt markers), preventing width drift when terminals emit semantic zone markers
- Fixed markdown blockquotes dropping nested list content by rendering blockquote children as block-level tokens

## [0.55.4] - 2026-03-02

## [0.55.3] - 2026-02-27

## [0.55.2] - 2026-02-27

## [0.55.1] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed

- Fixed Windows VT input initialization in ESM by loading `koffi` via `createRequire`, restoring VT input mode while keeping `koffi` externalized from compiled binaries

## [0.55.0] - 2026-02-24

## [0.54.2] - 2026-02-23

## [0.54.1] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed

- Changed koffi import from top-level to dynamic require in `enableWindowsVTInput` to prevent bun from embedding all 18 platform `.node` files (~74MB) into every compiled binary. Koffi is only needed on Windows.

## [0.54.0] - 2026-02-19

## [0.53.1] - 2026-02-19

## [0.53.0] - 2026-02-17

## [0.52.11] - 2026-02-13

## [0.52.10] - 2026-02-12

### Added

- Added terminal input listeners in `TUI` (`addInputListener` and `removeInputListener`) to let callers intercept, transform, or consume raw input before component handling.

### Fixed

- Fixed `@` autocomplete fuzzy matching to score against path segments and prefixes, reducing irrelevant matches for nested paths

## [0.52.9] - 2026-02-08

## [0.52.8] - 2026-02-07

### Added

- Added `pasteToEditor` to `EditorComponent` API for programmatic paste support

## [0.52.7] - 2026-02-06

## [0.52.6] - 2026-02-05

## [0.52.5] - 2026-02-05

## [0.51.3] - 2026-02-03

## [0.51.2] - 2026-02-03

### Added

- Added `Terminal.drainInput` to drain stdin before exit (prevents Kitty key release events leaking over slow SSH)

### Fixed

- Fixed Kitty key release events leaking to parent shell over slow SSH connections by draining stdin for up to 1s
- Fixed legacy newline handling in the editor to preserve previous newline behavior
- Fixed @ autocomplete to include hidden paths
- Fixed submit fallback to honor configured keybindings

## [0.51.1] - 2026-02-02

### Added

- Added `MISUL_DEBUG_REDRAW=1` env var for debugging full redraws (logs triggers to `~/.misul/agent/misul-debug.log`)

### Changed

- Terminal height changes no longer trigger full redraws, reducing flicker on resize
- `clearOnShrink` now defaults to `false` (use `MISUL_CLEAR_ON_SHRINK=1` or `setClearOnShrink(true)` to enable)

### Fixed

- Fixed emoji cursor positioning in Input component

- Fixed unnecessary full redraws when appending many lines after content had previously shrunk (viewport check now uses actual previous content size instead of stale maximum)
- Fixed Ctrl+D exit closing the parent SSH session due to stdin buffer race condition

## [0.51.0] - 2026-02-01

## [0.50.9] - 2026-02-01

## [0.50.8] - 2026-02-01

### Added

- Added sticky column tracking for vertical cursor navigation so the editor restores the preferred column when moving across short lines.

## [0.50.6] - 2026-01-30

### Changed

- Optimized `isImageLine` with `startsWith` short-circuit for faster image line detection

### Fixed

- Fixed empty rows appearing below footer when content shrinks (e.g., closing `/tree`, clearing multi-line editor)
- Fixed terminal cursor remaining hidden after exiting TUI via `stop` when a render was pending

## [0.50.5] - 2026-01-30

### Fixed

- Fixed `isImageLine` to check for image escape sequences anywhere in a line, not just at the start. This prevents TUI crashes when rendering lines containing image data.

## [0.50.4] - 2026-01-30

### Added

- Added Ctrl+B and Ctrl+F as alternative keybindings for cursor word left/right navigation
- Added character jump navigation: Ctrl+] jumps forward to next character, Ctrl+Alt+] jumps backward
- Editor now jumps to line start when pressing Up at first visual line, and line end when pressing Down at last visual line

### Changed

- Optimized image line detection and box rendering cache for better performance

### Fixed

- Fixed autocomplete for paths with spaces by supporting quoted path tokens

- Editor auto-applies single suggestion when force file autocomplete triggers with exactly one match

### Changed

- Improved `extractCursorPosition` performance: scans lines in reverse order, early-outs when cursor is above viewport, and limits scan to bottom terminal height
- Autocomplete improvements: better handling of partial matches and edge cases

### Fixed

- Fixed backslash input buffering causing delayed character display in editor and input components
- Fixed markdown table rendering with proper row dividers and minimum column width

## [0.50.1] - 2026-01-26

- Center-anchored overlays now stay vertically centered when resizing the terminal taller after a shrink
- Fixed editor multi-line insertion handling and lastAction tracking
- Fixed editor word wrapping to reserve a cursor column
- Fixed editor word wrapping to use single-pass backtracking for whitespace handling
- Fixed Kitty image ID allocation and cleanup to prevent image ID collisions between modules

- Added Alt+Delete as hotkey for delete word forwards

### Changed

- Fuzzy matching now scores consecutive matches higher and penalizes gaps more heavily for better relevance

### Fixed

- Autolinked emails no longer display redundant `(mailto:...)` suffix in markdown output
- Fixed viewport tracking and cursor positioning for overlays and content shrink scenarios
- Autocomplete now allows searches with `/` characters (e.g., `folder1/folder2`)

## [0.49.2] - 2026-01-19

## [0.49.1] - 2026-01-18

### Added

- Added undo support to Editor with Ctrl+- hotkey. Undo coalesces consecutive word characters into one unit (fish-style).
- Added legacy terminal support for Ctrl+symbol keys (Ctrl+\, Ctrl+], Ctrl+-) and their Ctrl+Alt variants.

## [0.49.0] - 2026-01-17

### Added

- Added `showHardwareCursor` getter and setter to control cursor visibility while keeping IME positioning active.
- Added Emacs-style kill ring editing with yank and yank-pop keybindings.

### Changed

- Hardware cursor is now disabled by default for better terminal compatibility. Set `MISUL_HARDWARE_CURSOR=1` to enable (replaces `MISUL_NO_HARDWARE_CURSOR=1` which disabled it).

### Fixed

- Decode Kitty CSI-u printable sequences in the editor so shifted symbol keys (e.g., `@`, `?`) work in terminals that enable Kitty keyboard protocol

## [0.47.0] - 2026-01-16

### Breaking Changes

- `Editor` constructor now requires `TUI` as first parameter: `new Editor(tui, theme)`. This enables automatic vertical scrolling when content exceeds terminal height.

### Added

- Hardware cursor positioning for IME support in `Editor` and `Input` components. The terminal cursor now follows the text cursor position, enabling proper IME candidate window placement for CJK input.
- `Focusable` interface for components that need hardware cursor positioning. Implement `focused: boolean` and emit `CURSOR_MARKER` in render output when focused.
- `CURSOR_MARKER` constant and `isFocusable` type guard exported from the package
- Editor now supports Page Up/Down keys (Fn+Up/Down on MacBook) for scrolling through large content
- Expanded keymap coverage for terminal compatibility: added support for Home/End keys in tmux, additional modifier combinations, and improved key sequence parsing

### Fixed

- Editor no longer corrupts terminal display when text exceeds screen height. Content now scrolls vertically with indicators showing lines above/below the viewport. Max height is 30% of terminal (minimum 5 lines).
- `visibleWidth` and `extractAnsiCode` now handle APC escape sequences (`ESC _... BEL`), fixing width calculation and string slicing for strings containing cursor markers
- SelectList now handles multi-line descriptions by replacing newlines with spaces

## [0.46.0] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed

- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+D, etc.) now work on non-Latin keyboard layouts (Russian, Ukrainian, Bulgarian, etc.) in terminals supporting Kitty keyboard protocol with alternate key reporting

## [0.45.7] - 2026-01-13

## [0.45.6] - 2026-01-13

### Added

- `OverlayOptions` API for overlay positioning and sizing with CSS-like values: `width`, `maxHeight`, `row`, `col` accept numbers (absolute) or percentage strings (e.g., `"50%"`). Also supports `minWidth`, `anchor`, `offsetX`, `offsetY`, `margin`.
- `OverlayOptions.visible` callback for responsive overlays - receives terminal dimensions, return false to hide
- `showOverlay` now returns `OverlayHandle` with `hide`, `setHidden(boolean)`, `isHidden` for programmatic visibility control
- New exported types: `OverlayAnchor`, `OverlayHandle`, `OverlayMargin`, `OverlayOptions`, `SizeValue`
- `truncateToWidth` now accepts optional `pad` parameter to pad result with spaces to exactly `maxWidth`

### Fixed

- Overlay compositing crash when rendered lines exceed terminal width due to complex ANSI/OSC sequences (e.g., hyperlinks in subagent output)

## [0.43.0] - 2026-01-11

### Added

- `fuzzyFilter` and `fuzzyMatch` utilities for fuzzy text matching
- Slash command autocomplete now uses fuzzy matching instead of prefix matching

### Fixed

- Cursor now moves to end of content on exit, preventing status line from being overwritten
- Reset ANSI styles after each rendered line to prevent style leakage

## [0.42.5] - 2026-01-11

### Fixed

- Reduced flicker by only re-rendering changed lines
- Cursor position tracking when content shrinks with unchanged remaining lines
- TUI renders with wrong dimensions after suspend/resume if terminal was resized while suspended
- Pasted content containing Kitty key release patterns (e.g., `:3F` in MAC addresses) was incorrectly filtered out

## [0.38.0] - 2026-01-08

### Added

- `EditorComponent` interface for custom editor implementations
- `StdinBuffer` class to split batched stdin into individual sequences (adapted from [OpenTUI](https://github.com/anomalyco/opentui), MIT license)

### Fixed

- Key presses no longer dropped when batched with other events over SSH

## [0.37.8] - 2026-01-07

### Added

- `Component.wantsKeyRelease` property to opt-in to key release events (default false)

### Fixed

- TUI now filters out key release events by default, preventing double-processing of keys in editors and other components

## [0.37.7] - 2026-01-07

### Fixed

- `matchesKey` now correctly matches Kitty protocol sequences for unmodified letter keys (needed for key release events)

## [0.37.6] - 2026-01-06

### Added

- Kitty keyboard protocol flag 2 support for key release events. New exports: `isKeyRelease(data)`, `isKeyRepeat(data)`, `KeyEventType` type. Terminals supporting Kitty protocol (Kitty, Ghostty, WezTerm) now send proper key-up events.

## [0.34.2] - 2026-01-04

## [0.34.1] - 2026-01-04

### Added

- Symbol key support in keybinding system: `SymbolKey` type with 32 symbol keys, `Key` constants (e.g., `Key.backtick`, `Key.comma`), updated `matchesKey` and `parseKey` to handle symbol input

## [0.34.0] - 2026-01-04

### Added

- `Editor.getExpandedText` method that returns text with paste markers expanded to their actual content

## [0.33.0] - 2026-01-04

### Breaking Changes

- **Key detection functions removed**: All `isXxx` key detection functions (`isEnter`, `isEscape`, `isCtrlC`, etc.) have been removed. Use `matchesKey(data, keyId)` instead (e.g., `matchesKey(data, "enter")`, `matchesKey(data, "ctrl+c")`). This affects hooks and custom tools that use `ctx.ui.custom` with keyboard input handling.

### Added

- `Editor.insertTextAtCursor(text)` method for programmatic text insertion
- `EditorKeybindingsManager` for configurable editor keybindings. Components now use `matchesKey` and keybindings manager instead of individual `isXxx` functions.

### Changed

- Key detection refactored: consolidated `is*` functions into generic `matchesKey(data, keyId)` function that accepts key identifiers like `"ctrl+c"`, `"shift+enter"`, `"alt+left"`, etc.

## [0.32.3] - 2026-01-03

## [0.32.2] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed

## [0.32.1] - 2026-01-03

## [0.32.0] - 2026-01-03

### Changed

- Editor component now uses word wrapping instead of character-level wrapping for better readability

### Fixed

- Shift+Space, Shift+Backspace, and Shift+Delete now work correctly in Kitty-protocol terminals (Kitty, WezTerm, etc.) instead of being silently ignored

## [0.31.1] - 2026-01-02

### Fixed

- `visibleWidth` now strips OSC 8 hyperlink sequences, fixing text wrapping for clickable links

## [0.31.0] - 2026-01-02

### Added

- `isShiftCtrlO` key detection function for Shift+Ctrl+O (Kitty protocol)
- `isShiftCtrlD` key detection function for Shift+Ctrl+D (Kitty protocol)
- `TUI.onDebug` callback for global debug key handling (Shift+Ctrl+D)
- `wrapTextWithAnsi` utility now exported (wraps text to width, preserving ANSI codes)

### Changed

- README.md completely rewritten with accurate component documentation, theme interfaces, and examples
- `visibleWidth` reimplemented with grapheme-based width calculation, 10x faster on Bun and ~15% faster on Node

### Fixed

- Markdown component now renders HTML tags as plain text instead of silently dropping them
- Crash in `visibleWidth` and grapheme iteration when encountering undefined code points
- ZWJ emoji sequences (rainbow flag, family, etc.) now render with correct width instead of being split into multiple characters

## [0.29.0] - 2025-12-25

### Added

- **Auto-space before pasted file paths**: When pasting a file path (starting with `/`, `~`, or `.`) and the cursor is after a word character, a space is automatically prepended for better readability. Useful when dragging screenshots from macOS.
- **Word navigation for Input component**: Added Ctrl+Left/Right and Alt+Left/Right support for word-by-word cursor movement.
- **Full Unicode input**: Input component now accepts Unicode characters beyond ASCII.

### Fixed

- **Readline-style Ctrl+W**: Now skips trailing whitespace before deleting the preceding word, matching standard readline behavior.
